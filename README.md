# NoBash
The NoBash language aims to replace Bash scripting by combining the user friendly syntax of Python with the powerful Linux-integration of Bash.

You can find the paper detailing the creation process here

## Installation
To install NoBash, perform the following steps:
- Pull the code
- cd into programV2
- run `./setup.sh`. You must only do this *once*
- Optionally, you may add the local directory to your path
- You can now run scripts by calling the `nobash` binary like so:
  `nobash [script name].nb`

- Use `nobash -h` for help.
